### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**NickD-Dean/NickD-Dean** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Clustering & Classification project for customer segmentation and churn prediction
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Looker and Advanced SQL
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on problems related to customer and product analytics or climate change
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving the efficiency and cleanliness of my code
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dean.nicholas.d[at]gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not sharpening my data skills I'll be working on surfing/skiing, improving my rib rub recipe, or learning something new on the guitar.
